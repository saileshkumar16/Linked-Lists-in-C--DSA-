# ğŸ”— Linked Lists in C (DSA)

Welcome to the **Linked Lists in C** repository!  
This is your go-to resource for understanding and implementing various operations on linked lists using the C programming language.  

Whether you're a beginner diving into **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** or looking to refresh your knowledge, you'll find comprehensive examples and explanations here.

## ğŸŒŸ What are Linked Lists?

At its core, a **linked list** is a linear data structure where elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations.  
Each element (called a **node**) holds data and a pointer to the next node in the sequence.

ğŸ”— Imagine it like a chain â€” each link holds:
- Some data
- A reference to the next link

This dynamic nature makes linked lists incredibly flexible for operations like insertion and deletion, unlike arrays which require shifting elements.

## âœ¨ Why Linked Lists?

- âœ… **Dynamic Size**: Unlike arrays, linked lists grow or shrink as needed at runtime.
- âœ… **Efficient Insertions/Deletions**: Especially in the middle â€” just update a few pointers.
- âœ… **Memory Efficiency**: Only allocate memory when you need a node.

## ğŸ“š What's Inside?

This repository contains implementations of various **linked list operations** in C.

### âœ… Singly Linked List

- ğŸ”¹ Node creation
- ğŸ”¹ Insertion
  - At the beginning
  - At the end
  - After a specific node
- ğŸ”¹ Deletion
  - By value
  - By position
- ğŸ”¹ Traversal (printing elements)
- ğŸ”¹ Searching for an element
- ğŸ”¹ Reversing the list
- ğŸ”¹ Freeing the list (memory management)

> ğŸ“Œ Future updates will include:
> - Doubly Linked List
> - Circular Linked List
> - Sorting and merging linked lists

## ğŸš€ Getting Started

To compile and run the C code examples, you'll need a C compiler like GCC.
