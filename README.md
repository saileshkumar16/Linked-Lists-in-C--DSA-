🔗 Linked Lists in C (DSA)
Welcome to the Linked Lists in C repository! This is your go-to resource for understanding and implementing various operations on linked lists using the C programming language. Whether you're a beginner diving into Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) or looking to refresh your knowledge, you'll find comprehensive examples and explanations here.

🌟 What are Linked Lists?
At its core, a linked list is a linear data structure where elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. Instead, each element (called a node) points to the next element in the sequence. Think of it like a chain, where each link holds a piece of data and a pointer to the next link.

This dynamic nature makes linked lists incredibly flexible for operations like insertion and deletion, as you don't need to shift elements around like you would in an array.

✨ Why Linked Lists?
Dynamic Size: Unlike arrays, linked lists can grow or shrink in size during runtime. No need to pre-allocate a fixed amount of memory!

Efficient Insertions/Deletions: Adding or removing elements is generally faster than in arrays (especially in the middle), as it only involves updating a few pointers.

Memory Efficiency: They only use memory as needed for each node.

📚 What's Inside?
This repository will contain implementations of various linked list types and operations. Currently, you'll find:

Singly Linked Lists: The most basic form, where each node points to the next.

Node creation

Insertion (at beginning, end, after a specific node)

Deletion (by value or position)

Traversal (printing elements)

Searching for an element

Reversing the list

Memory management (freeing the list)

🚀 Getting Started
To compile and run the C code examples in this repository, you'll need a C compiler (like GCC).

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/saileshkumar16/linked-lists-c-dsa.git
cd linked-lists-c-dsa

Compile the code:

gcc -o main main.c

(Assuming main.c is the primary file for the linked list operations)

Run the executable:

./main

🤝 Contributing
